# Weather Web Scraping

The following repository contains code from an independent project focusing on web scraping and Tableau dashboard creation. The included notebook scrapes from the Weather Channel website, utilizing the Python package BeautifulSoup. Data is updated daily by automatically running the Python script through Google Cloud Platform (GCP) service Vertex AI's scheduling capabilities. Data extracted by the script is uploaded to a GCP BigQuery database. These tables serve as a data source for a Tableau Dashboard. The dashboard includes a summary of the current day's weather, as well as a 10-day forecast. This project provided an opportunity to learn new methods of data sourcing and enhance my Tableau and GCP skills.


Link to the dashboard on Tableau Public can be accessed below (Note: Due to Tableau Public constraints, data may not reflect the current conditions)
